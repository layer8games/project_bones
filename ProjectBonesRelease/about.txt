This folder will the finished binary files that result from the build of your project. That will include the final executable files that will be delivered to your end user. Additional folders will be created here to describe what build each file will have. For example, if you create a debug build, it will be placed into a folder called Win32_Debug, if you are building for a 32 bit windows system, in debug mode. Please note, any additional .dll file types that the final executable needs will need to be placed here manually.
