This folder will contain all of the implementation files. Sometimes this folder is the src, source or source_code folder. This folder does not imply any sort of organization. Your files here should only pertain to this project, since the engine will be built separately. It will just be dumping ground for all of your .cpp files. I suggest that you actually organize them in your IDE, like visual studio using filters. If you use the killer_common.props found in the Build directory, then this is automatically where the project will look for all of these implementation files.
