This folder will hold all of the relevant header files for the c++ project. If you use visual studio, and you use the killer_common.props found in the Build directory, then this will have a folder called Engine that will contain all of the engine headers. Additional folders should be created for additional include name spaces. For example, if you are creating a project called Project_Static, then I would suggest creating a folder called Static that will hold all of the headers that exist in the game space, that is the end project that will consume the engine files.
