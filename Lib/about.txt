This folder will hold any external static libraries that are needed to build the project. This will include the Killer Engine lib file that gives you access to the engine API to actually build your game. I don't suggest that you use any sort of folder organization, but that you simple place the lib files in here directly. The killer_common.props includes this as an additional include directory for a visual studio project.
